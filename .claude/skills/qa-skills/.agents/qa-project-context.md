## Risk Areas

> List the parts of your system that are most likely to break or have the highest
> business impact when they do. QA skills use this to prioritize test coverage.

| Area | Risk Level | Business Impact | Notes |
|------|-----------|----------------|-------|
| [Payment processing] | [High] | [Revenue loss, compliance] | [Third-party gateway, edge cases with currencies] |
| [User authentication] | [High] | [Security, user lockout] | [OAuth + email/password, session management] |
| [Data export] | [Medium] | [Customer trust] | [Large datasets can timeout] |
| [Notification system] | [Low] | [User engagement] | [Email + push, third-party dependencies] |

## Team

- **QA Engineers:** [e.g., 2 — 1 automation, 1 manual]
- **Total Developers:** [e.g., 8]
- **Dev/QA Ratio:** [e.g., 4:1]
- **Process:** [Agile Scrum / Kanban / Shape Up / etc.]
- **Sprint Length:** [e.g., 2 weeks]
- **QA Involvement:** [Shift-left — QA reviews specs before dev / traditional — QA tests after dev]
- **Team Maturity:** [startup / growing / established]
  - *startup* — early product, small team, limited QA process, focus on critical path coverage
  - *growing* — established team, CI in place, expanding coverage and tooling
  - *established* — mature QA practice, advanced tooling, metrics-driven, compliance/SLA requirements

---

## Conventions

### Test Files
- **Naming Pattern:** [e.g., *.spec.ts for E2E, *.test.ts for unit]
- **Co-located or Separate:** [Tests live next to source / in a separate tests/ directory]

### Selectors (E2E)
- **Strategy:** [data-testid attributes / ARIA roles and labels / CSS selectors / mixed]
- **Naming Convention:** [e.g., data-testid="login-submit-button" — kebab-case, descriptive]

### Branching
- **Strategy:** [feature branches -> develop -> main / feature branches -> main / trunk-based]
- **PR Requirements:** [Tests must pass / code review required / QA sign-off for critical paths]

### Test Data
- **Strategy:** [Factory functions / fixtures / seeded DB / API-generated per test]
- **Cleanup:** [Each test cleans up after itself / DB reset between suites / shared state]

## Additional Notes

> Add any project-specific context that would help QA skills give better recommendations.
> Examples: known technical debt, upcoming migrations, compliance requirements (SOC2, GDPR),
> accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA), browser/device support matrix, etc.
