<objective>
A migration that passes `prisma migrate deploy` can still silently drop a column's data, and an `EXPLAIN` assertion that never fails will green-light a query that lost its index — both ship to production looking fine. This skill produces database tests that catch those: forward AND backward migration tests, constraint-rejection tests, deterministic seed data, drift detection, and query-plan assertions that actually fail when the index disappears.

**Before starting:** check `.agents/qa-project-context.md` for database type, ORM, migration tooling, and environment config — they shape every pattern below.
</objective>

## Discovery Questions

Check `.agents/qa-project-context.md` first — if it exists, use it and skip anything already answered there. Then:

1. **Database type:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, or multi-database? Each has different constraint syntax, migration tools, and performance profiling.
2. **ORM / query builder:** Prisma, TypeORM, Drizzle, Sequelize, SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, or raw SQL? The ORM determines migration tooling and test patterns.
3. **Migration tool:** Prisma Migrate, TypeORM migrations, Flyway, Liquibase, Alembic, knex, or custom? This determines how to test forward and backward migrations.
4. **Test database strategy:** isolated DB per test, transaction rollback, Testcontainers, or shared DB with cleanup? Affects speed and reliability.
5. **Existing seed data:** factories, fixtures, or seed scripts? Check `prisma/seed.ts`, `seeds/`, `fixtures/`, or factory patterns.
6. **Performance baselines:** any existing query benchmarks or slow-query monitoring?

---

## Core Principles

1. **Test migrations forward AND backward.** Every migration should be reversible. If a rollback fails, you cannot recover from a bad deploy. Test the `down` path, not just the `up` — and test it with the *actual* revert mechanism (a hand-written `down.sql` for Prisma, a native revert command elsewhere), not a metadata flag.

2. **Constraints are the first line of defense.** `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `FOREIGN KEY`, and `CHECK` constraints stop bad data at the database, regardless of application code. Test that each one exists and rejects invalid data with the right error.

3. **Deterministic seed data.** Tests must produce the same result every run. Use factories with fixed IDs and fixed timestamps, not random data. `faker.random()` without a seed, `uuid()`, and `now()` in seed data create non-deterministic tests.

4. **Isolate database state per test.** Tests that share state are order-dependent and flaky. Use transaction rollback, per-test databases, or guaranteed cleanup.

5. **Test the migration, not the ORM's sync.** `prisma db push` / `typeorm synchronize: true` skip the migration path your users will actually run. Always exercise the real migration files.

6. **A performance assertion that can't fail is worthless.** Prove the EXPLAIN test goes red when the index is dropped before trusting it green. See Verification.

## Migration Testing

For runnable migration test code, see `references/migration-tests.md`.

### Forward Migration Validation

Spin up a fresh, empty database, run all migrations with `prisma migrate deploy`, then assert against `information_schema` that the expected tables and columns exist with the right types, nullability, and defaults. Prefer a Testcontainers-provided `DATABASE_URL`; the admin-Pool `CREATE DATABASE` path is the fallback when you must target a standing Postgres — pick one strategy per suite, don't mix.

### Rollback Testing

Prisma has **no** `migrate down` / `migrate rollback` command. `prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back` is **not** a rollback tool — it only fixes a migration whose `migrate deploy` *failed*, and it throws on a cleanly-applied one. The supported test for a reversible change: apply forward, capture state, run the hand-written `down.sql` directly (`psql -f down.sql`), assert the reverted object is gone, then re-apply. Maintain a `down.sql` per migration directory.

For **TypeORM and Sequelize**, both ship native revert commands (`dataSource.undoLastMigration()`, `sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo`); swap them in for the `psql -f down.sql` step — the capture → revert → assert → re-apply shape is identical.

For **Drizzle Kit v1.0 (still beta as of mid-2026 — latest is `drizzle-kit@1.0.0-beta.22`, no stable GA yet; `0.44.x` is the conservative pin if you need stable)**: `drizzle-kit generate` + `drizzle-kit migrate`. Pin the exact version in CI — the v1 beta line reworked the `casing` API and removed RQB v1 `._query` for Postgres, and the API is still shifting between betas. Drizzle has no down-migration generator; check in your own inverse SQL, same as Prisma.

### Data Preservation During Migration

To test that an added column preserves existing rows, apply migrations up to N-1, insert data, then apply the migration under test and assert the rows survived (new nullable column carries its default or null). **`prisma migrate deploy` has no `--to` flag** — it applies *all* pending migrations. To stop at N-1, deploy a migrations directory containing only migrations up to N-1 (stage it in CI), then deploy the full directory. Tools with real targeting (Flyway `-target=`, Alembic `upgrade <rev>`) use the native flag instead.

### Migration Drift Detection

The most common real migration bug: someone edits the DB or the schema without a matching migration, so the committed migrations no longer reproduce `schema.prisma`. `prisma migrate diff --from-migrations … --to-schema-datamodel … --exit-code` returns non-zero on drift — wire it into CI as a fast pre-flight before the heavier tests. See `references/migration-tests.md`.

### Schema Snapshot Comparison

Capture a `pg_dump --schema-only` snapshot before and after the migration and diff table-by-table so only the intended tables changed. See `references/migration-tests.md`.

### Other ORMs

**TypeORM:** `DataSource` with `migrationsRun: false`, then `dataSource.runMigrations()` and `dataSource.undoLastMigration()` in tests. Same shape: apply all, verify schema, revert last, verify rollback.

**Alembic (Python):** test `alembic upgrade head` from empty DB, `alembic downgrade base` for full rollback, and an upgrade→downgrade→upgrade cycle to verify schema consistency. Use a fresh test database via fixture.

---

## Data Integrity Testing

For runnable constraint and referential-integrity code, see `references/integrity-and-seed.md`.

### Constraint Testing

Assert that each constraint rejects invalid data: `NOT NULL` rejects missing required columns, `UNIQUE` rejects duplicates, `FOREIGN KEY` rejects dangling references, `CHECK` rejects out-of-range values, `ON DELETE CASCADE` removes dependent rows. Assert on the database error message (`/null value in column/`, `/unique constraint/i`, etc.) at the `pool.query` level — not at the ORM or application-validation layer, which can mask a missing DB constraint.

### Referential Integrity & Data-Quality Audit

Run anti-join queries (`LEFT JOIN … WHERE parent.id IS NULL`) to assert there are no orphan records pointing at deleted parents. Then audit for the gap between *intended* and *enforced* integrity: `COUNT(*)` vs `COUNT(DISTINCT col)` flags a column that should be unique but lacks a constraint; `COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE col IS NULL)` flags one that should be non-null. See `references/integrity-and-seed.md`.

### Data Type Validation

Test: monetary values stored with correct precision (no float loss), VARCHAR length enforcement (`value too long` on overflow), and timezone-aware timestamps stored as UTC — insert with an offset (`+02:00`), retrieve, and verify ISO UTC output.

---

## Seed Data Management

For runnable factory, seed-script, and isolation code, see `references/integrity-and-seed.md`.

### Factory Pattern (TypeScript)

Build records from a `buildUser(overrides)` factory that increments a counter for stable, deterministic IDs and emails and uses a fixed timestamp (`new Date('2026-01-01T00:00:00Z')`, never `new Date()` with no argument), with a `createUser(pool, overrides)` helper that inserts and returns the record. See `references/integrity-and-seed.md`.

### Prisma Seed Script

Use `upsert` with fixed IDs so the seed is idempotent and re-runnable, and switch profiles on `process.env.SEED_ENV`: `test` (minimal, 2–3 users), `staging` (realistic volume, 50+ users), `demo` (curated). `staging` and `demo` extend `test`. See `references/integrity-and-seed.md`.

### Test Isolation with Transaction Rollback

Wrap each test in `BEGIN`/`ROLLBACK` so inserts never persist between tests. The module-level shared client works for serial runs (`jest --runInBand`); parallel test files in one worker need a per-suite client or savepoints. See `references/integrity-and-seed.md`.

---

## Query Performance Testing

For runnable EXPLAIN ANALYZE and index-validation code, see `references/performance-and-docker.md`.

### EXPLAIN ANALYZE Patterns

Run `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, FORMAT JSON)` on critical queries, read `plan.Plan['Node Type']`, and assert it matches `/Index/` (not `Seq Scan`) and that `plan['Execution Time']` is under threshold. See `references/performance-and-docker.md`.

### Index Validation

Query `pg_indexes` and assert the columns you rely on for lookups and range scans (`users.email`, `orders.user_id`, `orders.created_at`) are actually indexed. See `references/performance-and-docker.md`.

### Slow Query Detection

Seed realistic volume (10K+ rows), then measure execution time with `performance.now()` and assert critical queries (dashboard aggregations with JOINs, GROUP BY, ORDER BY) complete under a threshold (e.g. 100ms).

**MongoDB:** use `collection.find(...).explain('executionStats')` to verify index usage (`stage` must not be `COLLSCAN`), check `totalDocsExamined` is close to `nReturned`, and verify compound indexes exist via `collection.indexes()`.

---

## Docker-Based Test Database

**Preferred (2026): Testcontainers.** `@testcontainers/postgresql` 11.14+ (May 2026) is the lower-friction default — programmatic container lifecycle, auto-cleanup, parallel execution with distinct ports. It removes the docker-compose file and port-conflict bookkeeping. See `references/performance-and-docker.md` for the `PostgreSqlContainer` setup.

**Hand-rolled compose (still valid):** `docker-compose.test.yml` with `postgres:18-alpine`, `tmpfs` for RAM-backed storage, and a `pg_isready` healthcheck. Map to a non-default port (e.g. 5433) to avoid conflicts with local Postgres. Match the major version to production — Postgres 18 is current (18.4, May 2026); bump from 17 unless production is pinned.

Chain scripts in `package.json`: `test:db:up` (compose up), `test:db:migrate` (prisma migrate deploy), `test:db:seed` (prisma db seed), `test:db` (all + jest), `test:db:down` (compose down -v).

---

## Anti-Patterns

### 1. Testing against production database copies
Production data contains PII, is non-deterministic, and changes unpredictably. Use factories and seed scripts with synthetic data.

### 2. Shared database state between tests
Test A inserts a user; Test B assumes it exists; CI reorders them; Test B fails. Use transaction rollback or per-test cleanup.

### 3. Ignoring rollback testing
"We never roll back migrations" holds until the first migration breaks production. Test the `down` path. If the tool has no revert, that is a risk to document, not to skip.

### 4. Faking rollback with `migrate resolve --rolled-back`
That command only repairs a *failed* migration and throws on a clean one. It does not revert schema. Revert with the real mechanism: `down.sql` for Prisma, `undoLastMigration()` for TypeORM.

### 5. Using ORM sync instead of migrations
`prisma db push`, `typeorm synchronize: true`, Django `migrate --run-syncdb` skip the real migration path. Tests must use the same mechanism as production.

### 6. Testing only happy-path queries
A query that returns rows when data exists is the easy case. Test empty result sets, nulls in optional columns, max result sizes, and queries against the wrong data.

### 7. Performance assertions that can never fail
An EXPLAIN test that passes whether or not the index exists gives false confidence. Prove it goes red on a dropped index (see Verification).

### 8. Seeding with random data
`faker.random()` without a fixed seed, `uuid()`, and `now()` produce different data every run, making tests non-deterministic. Use fixed seeds and fixed values: `faker.seed(42)`, explicit IDs, `new Date('2026-01-01T00:00:00Z')`.

---

## Verification

Prove the suite actually catches regressions, smallest check first:

1. **Suite is green from clean:** `npm run test:db` exits 0 against a fresh Testcontainers database.
2. **The EXPLAIN test has teeth:** in a scratch DB, `DROP INDEX users_email_idx`, re-run the query-performance test, confirm it **fails** (planner falls back to `Seq Scan`), then restore the index and confirm it passes again. A perf test that stays green with the index gone is broken — fix it before trusting it. See `references/performance-and-docker.md`.
3. **Drift check fires:** `prisma migrate diff --from-migrations prisma/migrations --to-schema-datamodel prisma/schema.prisma --exit-code` returns 0 on a clean repo; hand-edit `schema.prisma` and confirm it returns non-zero.

---

## Done When

- A forward+rollback test file exists for the latest migration: forward applies from an empty DB and asserts schema via `information_schema`; rollback applies `down.sql`, asserts the reverted object absent, then re-applies — and it passes in CI.
- A constraints test asserts a rejection (with the DB error message) for each of NOT NULL, UNIQUE, FOREIGN KEY, and CHECK, at the `pool.query` level.
- A data-preservation test inserts rows before the migration under test and asserts they survive it (no fake `--to` flag).
- A migration-drift check (`prisma migrate diff … --exit-code`) runs in CI and exits 0 on a clean repo.
- Seed data is idempotent (`upsert` + fixed IDs) and switches profiles on `SEED_ENV`; re-running it twice produces identical state.
- An EXPLAIN test asserts `Node Type` matches `/Index/` and `Execution Time` is under threshold, and has been shown to fail when the index is dropped.
- The `test:db` CI job exits 0 (green) against a Testcontainers database.
