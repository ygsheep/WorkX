# GitHub Actions Templates

Copy-paste-ready workflow files. Drop into `.github/workflows/` and customize environment variables and secrets for your project.

Action versions reflect the current majors as of June 2026 (`checkout@v6`, `setup-node@v6`, `cache@v5`, `upload-artifact@v7`, `download-artifact@v7`, `dorny/test-reporter@v3`, `dorny/paths-filter@v3`, `marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v3`, `slackapi/slack-github-action@v2`). Keep them current with Dependabot; for third-party actions, pin to a commit SHA with a version comment.

## 1. Unit Test Workflow

Fast feedback on every push. Runs lint, type-check, and unit tests with coverage.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/unit-tests.yml
name: Unit Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

concurrency:
  group: unit-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  unit-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 10

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v6
        with:
          node-version: 22
          cache: npm

      - run: npm ci

      - name: Lint
        run: npm run lint

      - name: Type-check
        run: npm run type-check

      - name: Run unit tests with coverage
        run: npm test -- --ci --coverage --reporters=default --reporters=jest-junit
        env:
          JEST_JUNIT_OUTPUT_DIR: test-results

      - name: Upload coverage report
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v7
        if: ${{ !cancelled() }}
        with:
          name: coverage-report
          path: coverage/
          retention-days: 7

      - name: Upload test results
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v7
        if: ${{ !cancelled() }}

          retention-days: 7
```

## 2. Playwright E2E Workflow

Runs Playwright tests sharded across multiple runners. Caches browsers to avoid reinstalling on every run. Merges reports from all shards into a single HTML report.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml
name: E2E Tests

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  push:
    branches: [main]

concurrency:

## 3. Full CI Pipeline

Multi-job pipeline with proper dependencies. Lint and unit tests run first, then E2E, then deploy. Uses concurrency groups to cancel stale runs.

## 4. Nightly Full Suite

Scheduled to run the complete test suite every night across all browsers, plus a security scan (`npm audit`) and an accessibility audit (`@axe-core/playwright`). Sends a Slack notification on failure.

## 5. PR Quality Gate

Runs on pull requests. Posts test results as a PR comment and blocks merge on failure. Combines lint, unit tests, and a quick E2E smoke suite.

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v6
        with: { node-version: 22, cache: npm }

          npm run lint

## 6. Conditional Execution

Only run E2E when frontend code or the Playwright config changes, saving CI time on backend-only PRs.

```yaml
- name: Detect changed files
  id: changes
  uses: dorny/paths-filter@v3
  with:
    filters: |
      frontend:
        - 'src/**'
        - 'e2e/**'
      backend:
        - 'api/**'
        - 'lib/**'
      config:
        - 'package.json'
        - 'playwright.config.ts'

- name: Run E2E tests
  if: steps.changes.outputs.frontend == 'true' || steps.changes.outputs.config == 'true'
  run: npx playwright test

- name: Run API tests
  if: steps.changes.outputs.backend == 'true' || steps.changes.outputs.config == 'true'
  run: npm run test:api
```

---

## 7. Reproduce CI Locally

When a test fails only in CI, replicate the CI container locally using the **same** Playwright image tag your pipeline runs — never a stale one. Keep this in sync with your installed `@playwright/test` version.

```bash
# Match the version you run in CI; v1.60.0 shown as the current release
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/work -w /work \
  mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.60.0-noble \
  npx playwright test --project=chromium
```

---

## Usage Notes

### Customizing for Your Project

1. **Replace `npm test`** with your actual test command (`npx jest`, `npx vitest`, etc.)
2. **Replace `npm start`** with however your app starts (`npm run dev`, `npx serve dist`, etc.)
3. **Set secrets** in GitHub repo Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
4. **Adjust shard counts** based on test suite size. Rule of thumb: aim for 3-5 minutes per shard.
5. **Adjust `timeout-minutes`** based on your suite's actual duration plus a 50% buffer.

### Shard Count Guidelines

| Suite Size | Recommended Shards | Expected Duration |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| < 50 tests | 1-2 | 2-5 min |
| 50-200 tests | 3-4 | 4-8 min |
| 200-500 tests | 4-6 | 5-10 min |
| 500+ tests | 6-10 | 5-10 min |

### Required npm Scripts

These workflows assume these scripts exist in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "type-check": "tsc --noEmit",
    "test": "jest",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "deploy": "your-deploy-command"
  }
}
```

### Required Packages

```bash
# For unit test reporting
npm install -D jest-junit

# For E2E tests
npm install -D @playwright/test

# For the nightly accessibility audit (@a11y specs)
npm install -D @axe-core/playwright

# For waiting on the app to start in CI
npm install -D wait-on
```

### Coverage Config

Enforce the coverage floor in the runner config so the test command exits non-zero below it, and emit `json-summary` so the PR-comment step can read `coverage/coverage-summary.json`. In `jest.config.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  coverageReporters: ['text', 'json-summary', 'lcov'],
  coverageThreshold: { global: { lines: 80, statements: 80, branches: 70 } },
};
```

There is no `coverage-summary` CLI; for nyc/c8 projects use `nyc report --reporter=text-summary` (the standalone `istanbul` CLI is deprecated).
